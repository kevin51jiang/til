      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_Cat" target="_blank">Canon Cat</a> was a computer designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jef_Raskin" target="_blank">Jef Raskin</a>, who also dreamed up the Apple Macintosh. Steve Jobs meddled too much in the Mac and Raskin left Apple to create the Cat<a href="#fn:swyft" id="fn:swyft.ref" data-footnote-ref aria-label="note"><sup>1</sup></a>. It was a commercial flop, but had some awesome ideas mostly lost to time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Raskin was no fan of the computer mouse<a href="#fn:hth" id="fn:hth.ref" data-footnote-ref aria-label="note"><sup>2</sup></a> and thought keyboard driven UIs could be much more powerful, and the Cat has a couple tricks which show that he was truly onto something, most notably: <em>Leap</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cat keyboard is really unique. This computer has no mouse and no arrow keys<a href="#fn:creep" id="fn:creep.ref" data-footnote-ref aria-label="note"><sup>3</sup></a>. Instead it has “Leap” keys under the space bar.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            To move around you hold down a Leap key with your thumb (in the direction you want to move) and start typing the thing you want to move to. The cursor moves in real-time with each key press.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If you got it wrong you can hit “Undo” to go back.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            To keep looking for the same thing, hold “Use Front”<a href="#fn:use-front" id="fn:use-front.ref" data-footnote-ref aria-label="note"><sup>4</sup></a> and “Leap Again”.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            There’s a dedicated “Page” button so you can Leap through page by page to rapidly move through a large file (or press it on its own to create a new blank page).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Pressing both Leap keys highlights the text between the cursor and the previously leapt location. Leaping with highlighted text moves that text along with the cursor.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is so different from what we’re used to that it seems like it might be frustrating to use and rightfully part of history instead of current kit, but I find this inspiring. I wish I could get my computer to work this way!
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve been using VIM exclusively the last few weeks and trying to get used to it. I’m realizing that I spend way more time <em>moving around</em> then I actually do typing new things. I’ve come to really appreciate the <code>/</code> and <code>?</code> commands which search ahead and back for some text to move towards. It’s very powerful, but slightly awkward to use, so I find myself not using it as much as I should. Having that functionality under my thumbs would feel like a super power.
      </p>
      <p>
        There aren’t that many Canon Cats still floating around, but if you want to get a feel for what using one of these is like, you can run its <a href="https://archive.org/details/canoncat" target="_blank">software in emulation mode</a> thanks to the Internet Archive! How to use this is not very clear, but here’s what I figured out so far:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            option keys (left and right) are Jump
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <code>\</code> key is Undo
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            control is “Use Front”
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Full screen the emulator to immerse yourself!
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Obviously, it’s not quite the same as having the Cat keyboard in front of you, but I still found it very curious to use and gave me confidence that this could be an easily learned and very fun to use digital world to live in.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are surprisingly almost no modern tools that reference back to Leap and the Canon Cat. One notable exception is the <a href="https://100r.co/site/left.html" target="_blank">Left</a> text editor by Hundred Rabbits, which very recently <a href="https://twitter.com/hundredrabbits/status/1466832328462790656?s=21" target="_blank">added Leap</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some resources with a lot more content, digitized instruction manuals, history, and other bits and bobs down this particular rabbit hole:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <a href="http://www.canoncat.net/" target="_blank">canoncat.net</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.canoncat.org/" target="_blank">canoncat.org</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=642" target="_blank">Canon Cat on old-computers.com</a>
          </p>
        </li>

          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Finally, I’ll leave you with this convincing promotional video showing off the Cat in use, showing both more of what it can do<a href="#fn:calc" id="fn:calc.ref" data-footnote-ref aria-label="note"><sup>5</sup></a> as well as some truly excellent ’80s hairstyles.

            <p>
              Jef Raskin started the project by founding a company, Information Appliances, and called the computer SWYFT: “Superb With Your Favorite Typing”. Canon acquired his company and their marketing team came up with the name “Cat.” No idea if Apple intentionally took a pot-shot at Jef with Swift.
            </p>

          </li>
          <li id="fn:hth">
            <p>
              Jef Raskin briefly discussed the Canon Cat’s Leap innovation in an <a href="https://youtu.be/1qvrOEExlps?t=1337" target="_blank">Feb 1992 episode</a> of High Tech Heros, a public access show from Los Altos.
            </p>
            <a href="#fn:hth.ref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="return">↩</a>
          </li>
          <li id="fn:creep">
            <p>
              Arrow behavior is kinda still there. Tapping Leap on its own moves the cursor ahead by one. they fittingly called this “Creep”. Shift+Leap would scroll the page up and down.
            </p>
            <a href="#fn:creep.ref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="return">↩</a>
          </li>
          <li id="fn:use-front">
            <p>
              The “Use Front” key is essentially your “Command” key, but they printed the commands on the front of the key caps, hence “Use Front”.
            </p>
            <a href="#fn:use-front.ref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="return">↩</a>
          </li>
          <li id="fn:calc">
            <p>
              Like running calculations (or code!) live in a document with a key press instead of having a dedicated calc app. Really cool ideas.
            </p>
