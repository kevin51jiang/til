After months of lusting after my own microblogging site for posting random TILs,
now I have one! I hope that this will be a way to make the constant rabbit holes
I go down at least somewhat productive, even if only for other people.

I'm taking [Lee Byron's template](https://github.com/leebyron/til), which is
great for me because it's not overly complex, and relies upon JS rather than
Python.

I hope to actually post at last a few sentences daily from now on. Cheers!
